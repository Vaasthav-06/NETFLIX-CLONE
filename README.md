# 🎬 NETFLIX Clone - HTML/CSS

This is my very first hands-on project in web development — and trust me, building this was a lot of fun!  
After gaining a solid understanding of HTML and CSS, I decided to challenge myself with a frontend clone of the Netflix landing page.

This project helped me reinforce core layout concepts, responsiveness, and clean structuring using only HTML and CSS.

## 📝 Reflections

As this was my very first web development project, I approached it with the goal of applying everything I’ve learned so far in HTML and CSS. It was an incredibly fun and rewarding 8-hour experience — though I’ll admit, getting the responsiveness just right definitely had me scratching my head! 😅

Still, it pushed me to think deeper and problem-solve like a real developer. I’m proud of how it turned out, and even more excited to continue my journey — next up: **JavaScript**! 🚀
